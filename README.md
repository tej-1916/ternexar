# TERNEXAR (v2.0.0)

**A stable, high-integrity terminal safety operator.**

TERNEXAR is a command-line interface designed to bridge the gap between local LLMs and terminal automation. It provides a deterministic safety layer that ensures terminal AI remains helpful, transparent, and—above all—safe.

## v2.0: Confirmed Installer Execution

Release v2.0 introduces **Confirmed Installer Execution**, allowing TERNEXAR to safely execute verified installer profiles for common development tools under strict safety constraints.

- **Verified Profile Execution:** Execute trusted installer profiles for tools like `python3` and `nodejs` on supported systems.
- **Two-Step Strong Confirmation:** Mandatory two-step confirmation (boolean choice + exact string match) for all high-risk installations.
- **Subprocess Safety Model:** Strict use of `shell=False`, list arguments, and no shell metacharacters for execution.
- **Mandatory Preflight Gate:** Installations only proceed if `tx install-preflight` issues a `READY_FOR_FUTURE_CONFIRMED_EXECUTION` verdict.
- **Post-Install Verification:** Automatically verifies the installed version after the execution sequence finishes.
- **Audit Compliance:** Detailed logging of every phase (Request, Preflight, Confirmation, Execution, Verification).

## v1.9: Installer Preflight

Release v1.9 introduces a comprehensive **Installer Preflight** report that combines version checking and installer previewing into a single readiness verdict.

- **Ready-for-Execution Audit:** Performs a complete preflight report before future real installation capabilities.
- **Deterministic Verdicts:** Clear readiness status (e.g., `READY_FOR_FUTURE_CONFIRMED_EXECUTION` or `ALREADY_INSTALLED`).
- **Safety Pipeline Integration:** Every installer step is automatically evaluated by TERNEXAR's Risk, Gate, and Confirmation engines.
- **No-Execution Guarantee:** Explicitly refuses to execute any installation commands, ensuring system integrity in v1.9.
- **Operator Integration:** Natural requests like "check install readiness for python 3" or "preflight nodejs" are automatically routed to the safe preflight interface.
- **Audit Logging:** Every preflight check is recorded in the local safety audit log with its final verdict.

## v1.8: Installer Version Check

Release v1.8 introduces a safe, deterministic way to check if trusted tools are installed and report their versions.

- **Safe Version Check:** Verify the presence and version of tools like `python3`, `node`, and `npm` (`tx version-check`).
- **Deterministic Verification:** Uses hardcoded, non-destructive commands (e.g., `python3 --version`) from verified profiles.
- **Safety Pipeline Integration:** Every version check command is automatically evaluated by TERNEXAR's Risk, Gate, and Confirmation engines.
- **No-Install Guarantee:** Explicitly refuses to execute any installation commands, ensuring system integrity.
- **Operator Integration:** Natural requests like "is node installed?" or "check python version" are automatically routed to the safe version-check interface.
- **Audit Logging:** Every check is recorded in the local safety audit log.

## v1.7: Installer Profiles Preview

Release v1.7 introduces a safe, deterministic way to preview system tool installations.

- **Installer Preview:** View deterministic installation steps for tools like `python3` and `nodejs` (`tx install-preview`).
- **Safety Pipeline Integration:** Every suggested installer command is automatically evaluated by TERNEXAR's Risk, Gate, and Confirmation engines.
- **Deterministic Profiles:** Uses hardcoded, community-verified profiles mapped to your specific OS (Ubuntu/Debian-like Linux supported initially).
- **No-Execution Guarantee:** Clearly displays suggested commands and their risk levels without executing anything.
- **Operator Integration:** Natural requests like "install python 3" are automatically routed to the safe preview interface.

## v1.6: Natural Command Routing

Release v1.6 introduces a seamless natural language interface to TERNEXAR's safety-first pipeline.

- **Natural Operator Routing:** The `tx operator` now understands natural requests like "setup this project", "scan my web project", or "fix import error".
- **Deterministic Intent Mapping:** Safely routes requests to existing components (Locator, Workspace Viewer, Setup Assistant, Safe Fix Mode).
- **Target Extraction:** Automatically identifies project names and paths from natural text.
- **Install Request Safety:** Intercepts system installation requests (e.g., "install python") and provides clear, preview-only feedback without execution.
- **Transparent Feedback:** Shows detected intent, routed action, and safety decisions in real-time.

## v1.5: Safe Setup Assistant

Release v1.5 introduces a proactive project setup preview system.

- **Setup Preview:** Analyzes projects and generates safe setup instructions (`tx setup-preview`).
- **No-Execution Guarantee:** Displays what commands *would* run without actually executing them.
- **Project Intelligence:** Detects Python, Node, Rust, and Go project structures.

## Safety & Philosophy

TERNEXAR operates on a strict **Ask → Plan → Risk → Execute** pipeline. 

1. **Local-First:** All intelligence is powered by local models (via Ollama). No data ever leaves your machine.
2. **Deterministic Risk:** Safety is not an "opinion" generated by an LLM. It is enforced by a rule-based engine that identifies dangerous patterns.
3. **Auditability:** Every safety decision and execution attempt is logged to a local, tamper-evident audit file.

## v1.4: Custom Workspace Roots

Release v1.4 introduces custom project discovery and operator integration.

- **Workspace Roots:** Add custom safe search roots for project discovery (`tx workspace add`).
- **Integrated Operator:** Locate and inspect projects using natural language in the operator composer.
- **Strict Path Validation:** Refuses system paths, hidden folders, and directories outside the user home.
- **No-Bloat Search:** Fast, recursive discovery without background indexing.

## v1.3: Safe Workspace Discovery

Release v1.3 introduces read-only tools to find and inspect local projects safely.

- **Project Locator:** Search safe user folders for matching project directories (`tx locate`).
- **Workspace Viewer:** Show a read-only, safe project folder tree (`tx view`).
- **Project Intelligence:** Detect project type and dependencies without executing code (`tx scan`).
- **Strict Guardrails:** Blocks access to sensitive files like `.env`, `*.key`, and system directories.

## v1.2: Safe Fix Mode

Release v1.2 introduces a proactive analysis and safe patching system.

- **Deterministic Analysis:** Automatically detects common Python issues like `ModuleNotFoundError` and `ImportError`.
- **Safe Patching:** Suggests surgical patches (e.g., adding a dependency to `requirements.txt`).
- **Unified Diff Preview:** Shows exactly what will change before applying any modifications.
- **Explicit Confirmation:** Requires `y/N` confirmation for every patch.
- **Atomic Writes & Backups:** Creates safe backups in `.ternexar/backups/` and applies changes atomically.
- **Strict Guardrails:** Blocks modifications to `.env`, hidden files, or dangerous file paths.

## v1.1: The Operator Composer

Release v1.1 introduces an interactive orchestration layer.

- **Operator Composer:** A modern, interactive terminal input bar (`tx operator`) for natural language orchestration.
- **Context Awareness:** Include file context safely using `@path/to/file` in the operator.
- **Verified Execution:** Safely execute LOW-risk commands (e.g., `ls`, `git status`) via a strict allowlist.
- **Robust Guardrails:** Blocks dangerous commands (e.g., `rm -rf /`, `cat .env`) and prevents shell-injection.
- **Full Observability:** Track every action with `tx audit`.
